### Hi there üëã I'm Shreya

I'm a Full Stack developer from Seattle, Washington experienced in Ruby on Rails, React, React Native & Javascript. I transitioned into software engineering from a data science (analytics) background.

Having worked in the core team in one of Asia's largest ride-hailing companies, Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd.), I developed a knack for seeing trends & understanding the impact of various metrics to business. I developed statistical data-driven insights to enable busines decisions. In working alongside software engineering and product teams, I discovered my interest in coding & development.
